\title{Visualize gene counts in spots in space. Can also see group assignment of
spots.}
\usage{
vizGeneCounts(
  df,
  gene,
  groups = NA,
  group_cols = NA,
  size = 7,
  stroke = 0.5,
  a = 1,
  plotTitle = NA,
  showLegend = TRUE,
  overlay = NA
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{data.frame where rows are spots and columns must be at least:
"x", "y" for spot positions in space and "gene" column that is counts
of a gene for each spot.}

\item{gene}{column name of the gene counts in df to be visualized}

\item{groups}{colors the spots lines based on a group or cell layer
they belong to. Needs to be a character vector in the order of the spot
rows in df. Ex: c("0", "1", "0", ...)}

\item{group_cols}{color labels for the groups. Ex: c("0" = "gray", "1" = "red")}

\item{size}{size of the geom_points to plot (default: 7)}

\item{stroke}{thickness of the geom_point lines to help in emphasizing groups
(default: 2)}

\item{a}{alpha value for the viridis color fill scale (default = 0)}

\item{plotTitle}{option to add a title to the plot}

\item{showLegend}{Boolean to show the plot legend}

\item{overlay}{plot the scatterpies on top of a raster image of the H&E tissue
(default: NA)}
}
\description{
Note: visualized one gene at a time. Can set up a loop to plot
a different gene column in df individually.
