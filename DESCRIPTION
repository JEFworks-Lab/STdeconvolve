Description: STdeconvolve as an unsupervised, reference-free approach to infer
    latent cell-type proportions and transcriptional profiles within
    multi-cellular spatially-resolved pixels from spatial transcriptomics (ST)
    datasets. STdeconvolve builds on latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), a
    generative statistical model commonly used in natural language processing
    for discovering latent topics in collections of documents. In the context of
    natural language processing, given a count matrix of words in documents, LDA
    infers the distribution of words for each topic and the distribution of
    topics in each document. In the context of ST data, given a count matrix of
    gene expression in multi-cellular ST pixels, STdeconvolve applies LDA to
    infer the putative transcriptional profile for each cell-type and the
    proportional representation of each cell-type in each multi-cellular ST
    pixel.
